We have owned an apartment in Los Urrutias for years. In 2024, we took the plunge, sold everything in Germany and emigrated to Spain. We are self-employed here with a small German service business and now want to give others the opportunity to experience the flair and lifestyle of this area.</typography><typography>We love this country and want to inspire others to love it too. It is important to us that we, as landlords, are always on site and available as a point of contact. We handle the rental ourselves. For you as our tenant, this means that we carry out a final inspection (when the tenants leave) to ensure that you do not experience any unpleasant surprises on arrival and that the apartment is in perfect condition.</typography>"
